This is my target to beat this time around.\n","I have a couple improvements in mind. First of all, the data set cleaning has been redone as a team, so I won't have to redo it. Second, I want to perform feature selection with decision trees, rather than logistic regressors, and in the process correct some errors I made with feature selection last time.
